Description:
Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Code:
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int res = 0;
        for (auto num : nums) {
            res = res ^ num;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
