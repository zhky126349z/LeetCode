Description:
Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.

For example:

Given num = 38, the process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. Since 2 has only one digit, return it.

Follow up:
Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?

Solution:
Digital root。见https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_root
就有公式的，因为dr(n) = a * 10^3 + b * 10^2 + c * 10 + d (mod 9) = a + b + c + d (mod 9)

Code:
class Solution {
public:
    int addDigits(int num) {
        return 1 + (num - 1) % 9;
    }
};
