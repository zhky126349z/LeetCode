Description:
Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example: 19 is a happy number

12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1

Code:
class Solution {
public:
    bool isHappy(int n) {
        int flag[100000];
        memset(flag, 0, sizeof(flag));
        int res = n;
        int cal = 0;
        int temp;
        while (res != 1) {
            cal = 0;
            while(res != 0) {
                temp = res % 10;
                cal += temp * temp;
                res = res / 10;
            }
            res = cal;
            if (flag[res] != 0) {
                return false;
            }
            flag[res] = 1;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
