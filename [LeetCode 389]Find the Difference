Description:
Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

Example:

Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.

Solution:
开个数组存s中出现过的字母次数，再在t减，输出最后额外的。

Code:
class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        vector<int> dic(26, 0);
        for (auto& ch : s) {
            dic[ch - 'a'] ++;
        }
        for (auto& ch : t) {
            dic[ch - 'a'] --;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i ++) {
            if (dic[i] == -1) return ('a' + i);
        }
        return 'a';
    }
};
